## Dicey Dungeons Issue Tracker and website

Welcome to the Dicey Dungeons Issue Tracker!

See <a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/diceydungeons.com/issues">the issues page</a> for a current list of issues in the game. Please feel to add whatever you like!

I am hoping to add some basic analytics to the game in later versions, as well as the ability to submit feedback to this page from within the latest build. Stay tuned!

For up to date info about development of the game, see <a href="http://diceydungeons.com">diceydungeons.com</a>.

The Dicey Dungeons website is hosted on github pages from this repo. The `docs/` folder is the live website, and the `source/` folder is the Jekyll site used to generate it.
