At long last, version 0.8! Thanks for bearing with me with this delayed build - I'm very glad I took the extra week to do this new class properly! Let's have a look at it!

So! The Witch! How do I describe the Witch? 

The witch is *complicated*. Definitely not a class to pick for your first game. In the final version of the game, the Witch will probably be one of the last characters you unlock.

However, the witch is also *powerful*. Unlike the other classes, the witch isn't limited to whatever equipment she brings to the fight - the witch has four spell slots, which can be changed at any time. This means that you can, for example, cast four copies of a lockpick spell - and then use the dice you get from *THOSE* spells to cast even more spells, which combine and so on and so on...

In other words, the witch is a class for people who like building unstoppable machines.

I am very sure a lot of you are going to hate it, just like I'm very sure it's going to be some people's favourite class. I'm so happy with how it's come together!

<div style="text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -3%;">Elemental Magic</div>

I spent a *lot* of time on this update working on deepening the elemental magic system in the game. A lot of these changes are pretty subtle, but they dramatically improve the range of interesting things that are possible! This is still a work in progress, but here are the big changes:

**FIRE:** All fire attacks now also inflict a **BURN** status effect. Burn causes your dice to catch fire - you can still use them, but you'll take some damage if you do.

**ICE:** Ice has been majorly nerfed in v0.8! The **FROZEN** status effect no longer locks up a dice, but instead changes its value to 1. For some classes, this is devastating - for others, not really a big deal.

**LIGHTNING:** The old stun behaviour has basically just been renamed Lightning. **SHOCKING** an enemy with a lightning spell causes a piece of equipment to lock up! (you can drop a dice on it to release it).

**EARTH:** Finally, Earth damage, which I'm really happy about - attacking with earth causes a **WEAKEN** status effect, which downgrades equipment. There's actually a whole separate downgrade variation for every single piece of equipment in the game now, just like the upgrade variations!

Also, while I was at it, I scrapped the concept of poison and elemental immunity from the game, and instead replaced it with resistances, which I think are a lot more interesting. (This should mean that, for example, bringing a fire build against a Dragon isn't hopeless anymore!)

You might have seen <a href="http://distractionware.com/blog/2018/05/help-wanted-art-director-for-dicey-dungeons/">(on my blog)</a>, that I put up an ad for an Art Director for the game! I got a lot of submissions, and it's a very tough decision - but I hope to have some news about that soon.

Ahhhhhh, look at that 7drl screenshot! This game has come such a long way :D

<div style="text-align:center; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">So what about v0.9?</div>

Making new content is really fun, but it's probably about time I slowed down and started fixing some broken stuff. There are over <a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/diceydungeons.com/issues">100 open issues on the bug tracker</a>, including a few crash bugs, so for v0.9 I wanna tackle as many of them as I can.

There's a good reason for that too. *v0.9 will be the LAST free public build of the game* - so I want it to be polished, and stable! I'll be continuing with this whole open development thing after that, but from behind a paywall (on <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>!). I'll have more information about that next update!

Thanks for playing! See you in another two weeks!
